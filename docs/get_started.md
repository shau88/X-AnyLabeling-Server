## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Prerequisites

#### 1.1.1 Miniconda

**Step 0.** Download and install Miniconda from the [official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment with Python 3.10+ and activate it.

> [!NOTE]
> Other Python versions require compatibility verification on your own.

```bash
conda create --name x-anylabeling-server python=3.12 -y
conda activate x-anylabeling-server
```

#### 1.1.2 Venv

In addition to Miniconda, you can also use Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments. Here are the commands for creating and activating environments under different configurations:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv-server
source venv-server/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv-server\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 1.2 Install Server

#### 1.2.1 Git Clone

**Step a.** Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling-Server.git
cd X-AnyLabeling-Server
```

**Step b.** Install dependencies.

For faster dependency installation and a more modern Python package management experience, we strongly recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as your package manager. uv provides significantly faster installation speeds and better dependency resolution capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> PyTorch requirements vary by operating system and CUDA requirements, so we recommend installing PyTorch first by following the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) at PyTorch.

> [!TIP]
> For users in China, you can use a pip mirror, e.g., `-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple`, to accelerate downloads.

```bash
pip install --upgrade uv

# Option 1: Install core framework only (for deploying custom models)
uv pip install -e .

# Option 2: Install with example dependencies (recommended for first-time users)
# This includes ultralytics and transformers for running demo models
uv pip install -e .[all]
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to X-AnyLabeling-Server, we recommend using **Option 2** to install all dependencies so you can run the demo models out of the box. If you only plan to deploy your own custom models without these examples, **Option 1** is sufficient.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run the `sam3` service stably, make sure you are using Python 3.12 or higher, PyTorch 2.7 or higher, and a CUDA-compatible GPU with CUDA 12.6 or higher.</br>
> For `sam2`, you can directly install the `sam3` dependencies to build it.</br>
> For GLM and other API-based models, you can set the API key via environment variables (e.g., `ZHIPU_API_KEY`) in the terminal, or configure it in the model configuration file. Alternatively, you can deploy and integrate them using vLLM or SGLang.</br>
> For `rexomni` and `paddleocr_vl_1_5`, we recommend using the `[all]` installation mode to ensure all required dependencies are properly installed.</br>
> For `paddleocr_vl_1_5`, requires `transformers>=5.0.0` (install via `python -m pip install "transformers>=5.0.0"`). Use flash-attn to boost performance and reduce memory usage. If inference times out, adjust parameters (`max_new_tokens`, `max_pixels`, `spotting_max_pixels`, `spotting_upscale_threshold`) in `configs/auto_labeling/paddleocr_vl_1_5.yaml` based on your GPU memory. See details at https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL-1.5</br>
> For `pp_doclayout_v3`, requires the latest transformers development branch (install via `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git`). See details at https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-DocLayoutV3

After installation, you can quickly start the service with the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended:** Use the `x-anylabeling-server` command instead, which supports custom configuration files:
> 
> ```bash
> # Start with default configs
> x-anylabeling-server
> 
> # Start with custom config files
> x-anylabeling-server \
>   --config /path/to/custom/server.yaml \
>   --models-config /path/to/custom/models.yaml
> ```
> 
> For more configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md).

---

Test the API to verify that your model is loaded correctly:

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# List models
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models

# Run inference
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "your_model_id", "image": "data:image/png;base64,...", "params": {}}'
```

Once the server is running, open the [X-AnyLabeling client](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling) and follow these steps:

1. Configure the server connection in your user configuration file (default: `~/.xanylabelingrc`):
   ```yaml
   remote_server_settings:
     server_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000  # Update if using a different address or port
     api_key: ""  # Required if authentication is enabled
   ```
2. Launch X-AnyLabeling and press `Ctrl+A` to enable AI auto-labeling.
3. Open the model dropdown, navigate to the **CVHub** provider section, and select **Remote-Server**.

Now, sit back and let your remote models do the labeling work for you—enjoy the magic! 🤣

> [!TIP]
> For detailed instructions on using the client, see the [X-AnyLabeling User Guide](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/blob/main/docs/en/user_guide.md).
